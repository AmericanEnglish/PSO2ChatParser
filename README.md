PSO2ChatParser
==============

Python
=============

Sample.py
 - Used as a workspace for testing the validity of SQL insertion. The main focus is on pumping chatlogs into a PostgreSQL server.

timestamp.py
 - Used for detecting PSO2 timestamps in logs that will indicate a valid newline that was generated by the game not by a user typing "LOL\nOLO". 

chatparser.py
 - An older version of the parser. This is a command line only interface. If you're on Windows you will need to use the .bat because CMD does not support UTF encodings, many japanese characters will still look like gibberish because it doesn't even properly supoort UTF16.
 - This program supports two things
  1. You can search: num, phrase  . Every detected user is assigned a number
  2. You can seperate chats. This will pull out general chat and make it generally more readable than sorting through the several types of chat.

guiparser.py
 - This as of now is a WIP and may be written in either PyQT5 or TK. Whichever BETTER supports UTF16 to prevent the abusive "str".decode.encode business

main.bat
 - Runs chatparser.py on windows.

database.py
 - Used to abstract database jargin. Currently support the use of PostgreSQL and SQLite3. I doubt I'll look into MySQL or other variants until someone complains about it.

Updates will start being pushed out in python now! As luck would have the pyinstaller people have managed to get a "passing" build for windows. So I will continue to push this through. Although my alterior reason is that C++ has very poor UTF16 support when it comes to cross compiling. Excluding the UTF8CPP package which would take more time than it is worth for me to learn it the in's and out's of.

Goals
=====
1. SID       search
    * Pull down checkboxes
2. PID       search
    * Pull down checkboxes
3. Name      search
    * Pull down checkboxes
4. Keyword   search
    * Fill in blank
5. Day       filter
    * Calendar Widget
6. Time      filter
    * Time slider 00:00:00 -> 23:59:59
7. Chat Type filter
    * Checkboxes
8. Search by logname
    * This would allow a user to pseudo-filter a log by filename if they wanted too
9. Query SEGA's player database in hopes of build a similar, more local, version of a player's character structure
    * SID: 123456789
    * PID: 123456 <- autofilled
    * Character Names <- autofilled
    * This should help expand the searches to be much more inclusive.

Packages Used
=============
1. psycopg2
  * For using PostgreSQL as an option 
2. sqlite3
  * For using SQLite3
3. PyCrypto
  * For SHA256 hashing
4. PyQt5
  * The GUI packages

Current Progress
================
1. ~~Getting the database entry stuff down. It would seem that after much work SQLite3 just isn't a fan of ON UPDATE CASCADE.~~
  * Fixed by just dropping the older log file
2. ~~Adding a double progress bar for the "scanning" feature to show the progress of each file and the overall progress of the job~~
  * Just using a setText("text\nCOUNTER") method is quicker and just as good
3. ~~Designing Windows~~
  * All rough drafts have been finished
4. Starting Linking all the buttons, fields, checkboxes, to the Query Generator
5. Integrate PostgreSQL
  * Add a login window and that's it, make it modal.
6. Run queries and return the correct chat data
7. Make the settings work
  1. Changing databases
  2. Time formats
  3. Language
