PSO2ChatParser
==============

## I've decided to give up on the python implmentation for now. I may expand when making new features. Write test functions in Python and then write them in C/C++. Due to the lack of Windows compiling success from PyInstaller I've decided to just start this project over in C/C++. Breaking it down as such:

* GUI
  * C++ / GTK (For dat Glade)
* SQL & Parsing
 * C
* Query building and some basic input
 * C++

## New Stipulations
* With the release of Microsoft's Standalone compilers this seems more than feasible. 
* The database will remain entirely SQLite for now as I doubt the average user will be using PostgreSQL or MySQL.
* Gtk will be the GUI with the hopes that Glade will speed up the GUI building.
* The python version of this program will most likely remain and be expanded but will not be officially supported or well maintained.
* Wish me luck.

Python
=============

Sample.py
 - Used as a workspace for testing the validity of SQL insertion. The main focus is on pumping chatlogs into a PostgreSQL server.

timestamp.py
 - Used for detecting PSO2 timestamps in logs that will indicate a valid newline that was generated by the game not by a user typing "LOL\nOLO". 

chatparser.py
 - An older version of the parser. This is a command line only interface. If you're on Windows you will need to use the .bat because CMD does not support UTF encodings, many japanese characters will still look like gibberish because it doesn't even properly supoort UTF16.
 - This program supports two things
  1. You can search: num, phrase  . Every detected user is assigned a number
  2. You can seperate chats. This will pull out general chat and make it generally more readable than sorting through the several types of chat.

guiparser.py
 - This as of now is a WIP and may be written in either PyQT5 or TK. Whichever BETTER supports UTF16 to prevent the abusive "str".decode.encode business

main.bat
 - Runs chatparser.py on windows.

Packages Used
=============
 1. psycopg2
  * For using PostgreSQL as an option 
 2. sqlite3
  * For using SQLite3
